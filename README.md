# React Native To-Do App

This project I developed with React Native is a simple To-Do application with onboarding, task management, and persistent data storage with AsyncStorage.

## Özellikler

- **Onboarding**: When users first open the application, they see the onboarding screen.
- **Task Management**: Kullanıcılar görev ekleyebilir, güncelleyebilir, tamamlayabilir veya silebilir.
- **Permanent Data Storage**: Tasks are stored locally using AsyncStorage and are not lost when the application is restarted.

## Screens

### Onboarding

- Provides an introductory flow for new users.
- Shows animation with Lottie to provide users with a dynamic experience.
Users can skip or complete the onboarding process.


### Home Screen

- The main screen that greets the user after onboarding is complete.
- Users can go to the To-Do list or reset the onboarding status.
### To-Do

- Users can add, edit, mark as completed or delete tasks.
- Tasks are stored locally with AsyncStorage.
